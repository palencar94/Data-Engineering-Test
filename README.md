# Data-Engineering-Test
This is a data engineering test for a energy company in Brasil.


### Challenge

The goal of the challenge is to download a database in xlsx on Brazilian government fuel data and work with the data in pivot table. We have to structure this data in a way that we can store it in a SGDB and extract pre-defined KPI's from that data. 

For the challenge, we were asked to use two pivot tables in question: Sales of oil derivative fuels by UF and product
Sales of diesel by UF and type

### What did we use?

Oracle Virtual Box with centos 7;

Docker;

Python - jupyter notebook container;

Mysql container.

### Development

Development was done in two stages, the first one was handling the file to extract data from the pivot tables and the second part loading this data to mysql.
